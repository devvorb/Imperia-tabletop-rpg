# Introduction
Imperia is a tabletop RPG that like many others, provides a set of guidelines to experiencing grand adventures in fictional worlds. This is the the guide to Imperia, it is a fantasy world where everybody has access to magic. People do not have to master their element nor do they have to know of simple magic, a form a wizardry that is not person specific, but they can if they so desire. This system is very homebrew friendly, wich just means I think you should homebrew, not that I did anything special. 
The first thing you will want to read are the [core rules](https://github.com/devvorb/Imperia-tabletop-rpg/blob/master/README.md#core-rules) wich overviews all the basic elements that make this game. The next thing you will want to check out before starting a campaign is the [character creation](https://github.com/devvorb/Imperia-tabletop-rpg/blob/master/README.md#character-creation) guide, those are the two only things that are necessary in order to play.
You can find a guide to 4 of the most basic magics in the [magic starter pack](https://github.com/devvorb/Imperia-tabletop-rpg/blob/master/README.md#elemental-magic-basic-ideas)




# Core rules
* The dice system: as mentioned earlier, this system uses mainly d20, all throws that determine whether an action or not succeeds use a d20 and are assigned a difficulty (either through logic or rules), smaller or equal to the difficulty is a success otherwise it is a failure, the concept of critical success/failure is also used when a 1 or 20 respectively is rolled. The notation used for these throws is (dif x, y/20).
* Ease: ease is a the system used to make sure that two characters do not have the same chance of succeeding the same action (for example a chef and an archer participating in an archery contest shouldn’t have the same chance of succeeding). So players can say their characters have ease 1 (or 2 or 3, etc…) in a certain domain and that means that when the dice is thrown they subtract one from whatever they get. The only exception to this are critical successes and failures, a 1 is alway 1 and 20 is always 20, no matter the ease level. So, let’s imagine that your character is fishing in order to get lunch and he comes from a fishing village so we shall suppose that he has ease 5 and he rolls a 6, which would mean he has a critical success, but he doesn’t. Because if it did it would be too powerful. It is possible to have negative ease(meaning the character is not good at something and in that case you add the “ease” to get the roll). Also if the player gets something above 20 it is an automatic failure and under 1 is an automatic succes, no special things happen in those cases. Finally it is noted as follows (dif x, y-ease/20).
* Wealth: the wealth is system is inspired by the open legends RPG, meaning players have richness levels instead of a sum of gold coins. The gm is (unless specified otherwise) the one who decides when their Richness fluctuates and it is meant to fluctuate a lot. Items and other buyable items are associated with a certain richness level. Players start at richness level 2 and it can technically go up to infinity. It is up to the gm to decide how big they want to make the jump from one richness level to the next. The recommended gap from one level to the next is about “buying 3 days worth of food in advance”. So 0 would be none, 1 would be 1, 2 would be 3, 3 would be 6, etc… 
* Combat: the essentials of it are that it is a turn by turn game, every character plays one after another or every team plays one after another. Whenever a GM says so (or the rules) certain players may get a reaction or throw a dice to know if they get to react. Every action should be a very short action but a player can say they waste a couple turns in order to do something bigger, again it is up to the GM to decide if they get reactions during this time and how many turns this is. All so all living beings and some non-living ones have HP, when it falls to 0 they are k.o for living ones and gone for dead ones and if something is k.o then it can be killed (but if the GM decides that logically this monster or this character should have died before then he/she can kill the poor soul)

# Character creation
This section will overview the entire process of creating a character. A very important step in an Imperia game, after all what you make now will “be” you for however long you decide to make your games last. The first step is an unofficial one as it has no influence when looking at game mechanics and that step is to decide what kind of character you want. Imagining your character can be a great way to later decide the more precise things. You will not be searching for the same things in your character if you are making a woodcutter bent on finding the best wood in the world or if you are a bounty hunter that has been hunting a nobel for the past 2 years.

* The first "real" thing you will want to think about after having made your character is what elemental magic they will have. Here you must choose one element (element defined very loosely here) and then that is your magic. The only rule is that you cannot choose a magic deemed overpowered, everybody will have their own definition, but if you can insta kill someone without training, immobilise without restrictions, reincarnate without limits, etc… Then you probably have something overpowered. Although more in depth ideas will be given, a few examples of magics are fire, lightning, lions, seaweed, spice, earth, weather, animation, gravity and snowflakes. As you can see the game’s definition of element is not a common one.

* The second thing to choose is your hereditary power, hereditary powers as their names imply are powers transferred from one generation onto the next. It is chosen at random if a child gets the mother's power or the father's. Hereditary powers are single spells that people with them innately know how to use, but they do not have it mastered naturally. When they aren't mastered they do one thing and one thing only and unlike elemental or simple magic (magic that is not person specific) they cannot break the laws of logic.
* The third and final step is traits, traits are characteristics that you can give to your character that come with a drawback. That means there is no limit to how many traits you can give them, the stronger you make a character the “weaker” he is. Examples will be things like : “melee lover could be  a trait that makes you do one extra damage in all melee attacks but you have difficulty one when shooting at something far”. There is one “special” type of traits and those are civilisation traits, these don’t always come with a disadvantage, you can only pick one and represent where your character comes from. When a trait is defined in a rule book it will in general include precise information, but if you want to change something and the gm is okay with it please do. Once this step is finished you are ready to start a campaign. Good luck adventurers of all kinds. 

# Elemental magic basic ideas
This magic list is extremely small compare to the amount of available elements and the spell lists and rules of those spells are ideas more so than orders. You do not have to use these magics, you can make your own or take these elements and change the spells.
* [Water](https://github.com/devvorb/Imperia-tabletop-rpg/blob/master/README.md#water-magic)
* [Earth](https://github.com/devvorb/Imperia-tabletop-rpg/blob/master/README.md#earth-magic)
* [Fire](https://github.com/devvorb/Imperia-tabletop-rpg/blob/master/README.md#fire)
* [Air](https://github.com/devvorb/Imperia-tabletop-rpg/blob/master/README.md#air)

## Water magic

**Easy**
* Creation: very self explanatory, limits are applied through logic
* Manipulation: you can control water that is either created by you or that is natural. Limits are identical to creation
* Underwater breathing: this can be achieved through simple magic but as a water wizard you get it for free.
* Walk on water: same as underwater breathing

**Medium**
* Jet movement: you can use water as a jetpack allowing for free 3 dimensional movement, altough staying in the air is very hard, (dif 4-8) depending on the situation, normal movement is simple enough that no dice are needed, in addition to that you can increase your melee damage if it's speed is affected by this spell.  

* Drops: this may not sound impressive at all but controlling 1000 individual drops at a time is no easy task. In addition although alone they wom’t hurt or defend if 100 slow an arrow down (dif 12) or 100 hit one weak spot in a row (no dif) effects will be felt. A slightly more logic bending use is that the sound they make when hitting objects could be use to distract or even cast minor audio illusions (dif 10). You could use them with a weapon for cool effect like entering the ennemy blood system (dif 3-5) and cause all sorts of problems, or change an arrows movement mid flight (dif 9). 

* Water portal: Any body of water acts as a portal to nearby portals. The definition of nearby varies from case to case but if it's in combat rather close to the original water body, if there is a lot of time then almost anywhere the users been in before. This spell has alternatives where you “memorise” a pool of water and then go there at any time and from there to anywhere. For things other than you a dice is needed, (dif 15) for people you know really well, (dif 10) for non magic things and (dif 5) for other people's magic. A fail can either make you treat it like normal water or teleport to an unintended place, that is up to the gm to decide.

* Water self: you can turn your whole body to water in order to make attacks go through you. If used as a reaction (dif ~8) but no need for a dice if used as a preparation during a full turn. In this form you can still move, but can't cast magic, going back to your original form costs a turn. When in water form you can't take damage from most sources and can go through thin cracks and you obviously can't hit or hold things. Other people can try forcing you back into your human form if they are in contact with you with (dif 5) throw and can force you into water form with a (dif 2)

**Hard**
* Ocean world: you can teleport to a world that is infinite ocean in all dimensions. You can enter and exit it at will. And if someone is willing to enter it there are no dice throws and they can leave when they want. If you try and force someone into this dimension it is (dif 15) and if they try to get out it is (dif 5) you can only bring people into this dimension at the same time you enter it. Because of how powerful of a spell it is after using it on an unwilling subject you can only use it again if either you have had a night's sleep or if you have rolled a 20 or a 1 pre-ease calculations.

* Divine current: you create an extremely big wave that causes knockback on anyone riding it and massive damage. Very powerful individuals can try to resist it (dif 5-15). It does 3 damage + 1 victim hits a wall + 0.5 for any  victims that crash into eachother.


## Earth magic
**Easy**
* Creation: you create earth, with the speciality that it has to “grow” from earth

* Hurl: you create a relatively big ball of earth and magically throw it at you opponent

* Carve: you change the shape of existing earth by removing parts (no adding)

**Medium**
* Golem: you create moving living earth things that you can order around, they have 7 hp, if they try and hit an opponent enemy gets reaction and that dice is used to know if they get damaged or not, if they do get hit -2 hp. They can use the hurl attack but they lose 2 hp when using it, if used and it doesn't kill the Golem, enemy gets a reaction and if the hit lands -2 hp, but if it does kill the golem, instead of throwing a part of himself he throws himself all reactions get ease -3 and deals 4 damage. Because they are counted as living they get reactions

* Levitating rock: you can make earth that floats and you can manipulate these rocks from a far. They can be used for example, to make paths, movable walls, surprise attacks if the enemy doesn't know if it's  normal earth or magic earth, etc…

* Ground sense: you can hear/feel when anything enters in contact with the floor, and you can sense it from very far(country spanning distance), it isn’t very precise you don’t know who/what is walking (unless they have a very distinct feature, or it is someone you know like the back of your hand), but you know where with great precision, also you can sense the shape of the terrain (but not the water or plants). If it isn’t obvious it works in 360 degrees. You can do this whenever and does not take turn for close things, but if you want to sense something far (like an enemy army crossing the border) you need to use up a full turn.

* Geological illusion: this spell lets you make any earth/rock/metal formation look/feel/sound like anything with a similar shape as long as it doesn't contain large amounts of something's magic. It also doesn't work if the victim of the illusion explicitly looked at the formation beforehand. Although this spell is weak by itself in combination with the creation spell and a bit of planning it is very powerful.


**Hard**
* Earthquake: the earth violently shakes beneath you. The closer the ennemi is the more consequences there are. Within arm's reach -5 hp, ease -3 on next throw, no reaction next turn. Further -3 hp, ease -1 next turn, no reaction. Even Further -1 hp, no reaction. This attack damage to all surrounding enemies and allies. Once this attack is used you can't use it u

* Terrain modify: You can change the terrain as an action adding any of the following attributes: Cover (ease 3 when hiding), Spiky (falling or landing against a wall deals 1 damage), Rocky (ease -3 when aiming), Rock floor (When moving from place to place (dif 15) if you fail -1 hp), Magic heavy (spells of easy difficulty don’t work), Magic reinforcement (ease 2 when throwing a spell). More than one effect can be actif at a time and they affect everyone and everything.

## Fire
**Easy** 
* Fireball: you create and then throw a fireball anywhere dealing 1.5 damage to all those taken in the blast.

* Flame thrower: you make fire come out of some spot on your body, in a cone like shape. Dealing 1.5 damage to all those caught in the blast and dealing minor knockback on the user.

**Medium** 
* Healing flame: you can spend 1  turn in order to heal 3.5 hp to one person and remove any negative effect dealt to you by ice or other “cold elements”. Or you can grant yourself 0.5 healing per turn (every time you play including the turn this activated and excluding reactions).

* Heat illusion: You create very vague illusions that are sean by everybody and believed if you succeed a (dif 6-12) on a person of your choice (the dice is thrown for every person that you want that they believe the illusion is real). There is no limit on the size or the colors used but you cannot make precise things. Anybody inside the illusion also sees it, but they have ease -1 on throws requiring concentration.

* Blue flame: All of your fire attacks gain ease 3, deal 1 extra damage if they already deal damage and you gain an extra ease 2 on intimidation or impressing uses of your fire.

* Engulf: you surround anything of your choice with a fire that doesn't affect the surrounded item or person, while surrounded physical attacks deal 1 extra damage. When something is engulfed it is immune to your fire. There are many other uses for this ability but they are non-mechanical (for example scaring, a make believe wildfire, etc)

**Hard**
* Sun: You can create a small replica of the sun (obviously not at true temperature), the sun created by this spell has an area around it where if someone else than you finishes their turn in the area they lose 1 hp. Inside of this area your spells can come out of any place within (for example fire breathe doesn't have to come out of your body), you can have 2 active at a time but that divides the diameter of the affected area by 2. The area is about 10 meters in area by default. Deactivating one takes a turn and then activating one takes another turn.

* Forever burning fire: You can create a fire that cannot be extinguished by normal means, in order for it to disappear either the creator deactivates it or a mage who is far superior to the caster turns it off (dif 2-15). In addition to being forever burning, flames created by this have ease 3.

## Air
**Easy**
* Airpush: you can push anything near you approximately 5 meters away or push yourself 10 meters away. Enemies can try to resist it (dif 8-12), if they land against a wall they lose 0.5 hp. This attack has no limits to using it again and again.

* Distant punch: by punching in front of you, you can create an air blow that deals 1 damage.

**Medium**
* Fly: It is a pretty self explanatory spell, it does exactly as the name suggests.

* Slash: You can create slashes of air that can cut through things and move forward after being created. They deal 2 damage to the first person they enter in contact with, 1 to the second and 0.5 to the third. 

* Protective ball: You create an air ball around you that counters all light attacks in a random direction, if an attack is heavy (dif 5) to see if the shield breaks or not. Shooting things from the inside is impossible if they are light and heavy things create a hole in your defense for a brief moment.

* Masseless: You can remove some or all mass from an object or willing person. This make them agiler, more susceptible to knockback, give increased jump height. This spell is mostly used when throwing something or for agility.

**Hard**
* Tornado: You create a tornado that deals knockback (everyone and everything moves with the wind) and 3 damage if 2 things collide, il lasts 3 turns. You can create smaller ones if you just want the knockback. By creating a small one beneath you can propel yourself in a direction of your choice, you can create a “canon tornado” that shoots stuff out of the center, etc. The small versions can be used normally (GM and logic decide when you get tired), but the big version can only be reused after anyone roles a 20 or a 1.

* Collect: You collect all the wind created by every minor or major mouvement on the battlefield. During this time no wind spell can be used and through logic other elements. The more wind you collect the more powerful you get. During the activation of this spell you can either reinforce your collection to raise it by a “level” or do any non wind action that does not require concentration. Every 2 turns it goes up a level or if someone creates a lot of wind. You can either throw out all the wind at once you have ease “level”, deal “level”/2 extra damage and can have other effects if your gm agrees. Or you can use one level (this does not take a turn, wind created when using this ability doesn’t count) giving you ease 3 and making the action better through logic, you have unbreakable concentration, heightened perception.
